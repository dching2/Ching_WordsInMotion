Denny Ching Words In Motion

# project overview
In this project, we're asked to pick a section of a song, poem, or article that reflected the meaning of community.
When I think of the word "community" I think of people who had experienced similar experiences helping each other out when times are difficult.
A song that I immediately connect to the word "community" is Lean On Me by Bill Withers.
The reason why I chose this song is because in the lyrics "Lean on me when you're not strong and I'll be your friend I'll help you carry on..." it express the idea that when someone is going through tough times, they can lean on their friends and community for assistance and comfort.
I know whenever I'm going through a tough time or something that didn't work out in my favor I tend to go to someone whether it's a friend or family member to talk about it.
Essentially, my friend or family member will try their best to help me alleviate my situation and help me get passed it.
And thats what im getting from the lyrics is a sense of community and how it's important to check in with one another when times are rough.
# technical overview
Current Status On Website: About 60% completed.
- To create my Words In Motion, I used the Visual Studio Code
program to create my HTML and CSS for my lyrics.
- As the Words In Motion has multiple pages, five separate HTML files are created with
each having its own CSS file.
- The Font that was chosen is "Indie Flower" from Google Fonts.
- Since the song that I chose convey the message of community, I decided to add a variety of different movements to the words to emphasize it more and give it visual interest.
